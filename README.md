# Wrath of the Booze King (RandomLichKing)
New Year's Eve program that reminds you to drink and counts down at midnight in the voice of the Lich King from the Warcraft games and World of Warcraft.

Developed in 2020 and refactored in 2023, this app is a fun little addition to your New Year's Eve parties. After startup, the Lich King greets the players. The rules are simple, whenever the Lich King yells: "Frostmourne hungers", the players are to drink from their respective drinks. At midnight the "Lich King" counts down and wishes the players a Happy New Year and gives them an achievement.

Should you stumble upon this repo, we hope you have fun with it. 

Also, please drink responsibly and definitely <b>DO NOT </b> drink and drive! 

ENJOY!

### Notes
- The UI for the program was originally created with Netbeans but now migrated to IDEA.


### Rules
- Follow the orders of the Lich King and drink accordingly!
