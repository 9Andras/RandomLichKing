# RandomLichKing
New Year's Eve program that reminds you to drink and counts down at midnight in the voice of the Lich King from the Warcraft games

Developed in 2020, this app is a fun little addition to your New Year's Eve parties. After startup, the Lich King greets the players. The rules are simple, whenever the Lich King yells: Frostmourne hungers, the players are to drink from their respective drinks. At midnight the "Lich King" counts down and wishes the players a Happy New Year and gives them an achievement.

Should you stumble upon this repo, we hope you have fun with it.

# Notes
- The UI for the program was created with Netbeans. It contains Netbeans-generated code and project files.
- As of 04.12.2023. the program only works if the default media player is the microsoft default one (fixing required)
